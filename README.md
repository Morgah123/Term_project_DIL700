# Term_project_DIL700
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an Agentic AI system that autonomously performs self-directed model selection using tool-calling Large Language Models (LLMs). The system is built to automatically analyze a dataset, identify the machine learning task (regression or classification), select the appropriate tools, train models, evaluate them, and recommend the best-performing modelâ€”all without human intervention.
